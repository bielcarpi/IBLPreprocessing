# IBLPreprocessing

A Python-based machine learning toolkit that implements and evaluates multiple classification algorithms on different datasets. The repository demonstrates the application of various classifier implementations from scikit-learn, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Multi-layer Perceptron, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors with automatic parameter optimization
  - Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network
  - AdaBoost Classifier
  - Bagging Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier

- Built-in evaluation metrics and cross-validation
- Support for multiple datasets:
  - Digits dataset (built-in scikit-learn dataset)
  - 20 Newsgroups text classification dataset
- Text preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorization
- Model performance evaluation using various metrics

## Requirements

```bash
scikit-learn
numpy
```
